# GNN for Puns Detection and Location
### SemEval-2017 Task 7
### This is the Final Project of COSC-572 Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (ENLP)
Pun Detection: https://alt.qcri.org/semeval2017/task7/
## The Project including two tasks:
### Subtask 1: Pun detection
For this subtask, participants are given an entire raw data set. For each context, the system must decide whether or not it contains a pun.
### Subtask 2: Pun location
For this subtask, the contexts not containing puns are removed from the data set. For each context, the system must identify which word is the pun.
## Usage:
The file name of each file contains the models which it used.
All the files can be run in Google Colab.
For the Evaluation.ipynb, you can load a model (.pt file) from Google Drive and do the evaluation.
